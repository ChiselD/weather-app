FCC Weather App

Hi! This is the second intermediate-level front-end development project from FreeCodeCamp.com â€“ an app to show the local weather. It is not an original concept, but it is entirely my own original code.

The user stories for this project are as follows (copied from the website):

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
